When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to use multiple computers.  When you want multiple people to see the change.  When you want online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you only get changes you want.  So you don't have to constantly merge.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - A copy of a repository on github.
Clone - A local copy of a repository.
Branches - Different code paths in the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can use other peoples' changees.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I'd use Clearcase or Perforce.  It would mostly be easier because the release engineering folks at work would set it up for me.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You would work on a branch if your changes are extensive and you need to test and work with them before merging them down to the master.  You also would work on a branch if your changes will never come down because they are experimental or permanently on a different branch.  One benefit to using a branch is that it allows others to work on the master without interruption.
