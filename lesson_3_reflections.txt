When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to use multiple computers.  When you want multiple people to see the change.  When you want online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you only get changes you want.  So you don't have to constantly merge.
